## Why?
One day, I got this video in my YouTube recommandations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEXCYQKyDc. After watching it, I thought it was cool and was highly motivated to implement it so I took my Python IDE and got to work. 
If you want to discover steganography fast and not going too deep, you might want to read the beginning of this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)

## Versions
1.0: Upload.

## How to install and use it?
For this section, we will assume that you know how to use a computer but know nothing about programming. If you need any help, [contact us](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/README.en.md#contact-us).<br><br>

First, you're gonna need python. For this part, check [my tutorial on how to do so](https://github.com/reza0310/Tutorials/blob/python/README.en.md).<br>
Congratulations! You now have Python!<br><br>

Then you're gonna have to install the project. First download it as ZIP like you did for the last one from [this link](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie) (wich might be the link you're coming from). Then extract it into the parent project's folder. If it asks you if you want to replace files, approve.<br>
Congratulations! You just finished the installation!<br><br>

Now, to use it, check the [file-by-file description](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO/blob/main/README.en.md#file-by-file-description) to know wich script to execute and why.

## File-by-file description
- [LICENSE](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO/blob/main/LICENSE): A file expliciting your rights and duties about the project.
- [README.en.md](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO/blob/main/README.en.md): A file in english explaining everything about the project. This very file you are actually reading.
- [README.fr.md](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO/blob/main/README.fr.md): A file in french explaining everything about the project.
- [README.md](https://github.com/reza0310/ProjetTradingPythonPOO/blob/main/README.md): A file linking all languages README files.
- [Remplisseur.py](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/Remplisseur.py): EXECUTABLE. Makes you able to combine a picture to the [texte.txt file](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/texte.txt) to make an [image_remplie.png file](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/image_remplie.png) wich is basically the same image except the next file can get the text out of it.
- [Videur.py](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/Videur.py): EXECUTABLE. Makes you able to extract text from an [image_remplie.png file](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/image_remplie.png). You must know how many pixels to read beforehand in order to prevent you to having to find it trough many trys.
- [image.jpg](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/image.jpg): Just a basic image file (wich is in fact the combination of two images I bought, edited and cropped for another project) for you to try the scripts on.
- [texte.txt](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/texte.txt): A barely empty text file just for you to know where to write the text you wanna inject in the image.
- [image_remplie.png](https://github.com/reza0310/Steganographie/blob/main/image_remplie.png): An image containing text. Contains a very long text.
